[[Null Hypothesis]]:
- Related to **population**
- In the population, there is no difference in outcomes between groups.
- Odds ratio = 1
- Relative Risk = 1
- Risk difference = 0

[[Alternative Hypothesis]]: 
- In the **population**, there is a difference in the outcomes between the two groups
- Odds ratio is not 1
- Risk ratio or relative risk is not 1
- risk difference is not zero

[[p-value]]: 
-  Related to sample. 
- If the null hypothesis were true (i.e. there is no difference in outcomes between the two groups), what would be the likelihood that we would get this result **in the sample** by chance alone.
- small p-value means that it is unlikely that you got this result by chance alone which means you can reject the null hypothesis.

[[Confidence intervals]]
- Based on the results in the sample, what are the plausible results in the population?
- 95% confidence interval: Based on the results in the sample, we are 95% certain that the results in the population would fall in this interval.
- Can be done for continuous outcomes as well.
- If the 95% confidence interval includes the value of no difference, you accept the null hypothesis. 

>When we say that the results in the sample are statistically significant, it means that the null hypothesis is rejected and we accepted the alternative hypothesis.
>p-value < 0.05
>95% confidence interval doesn't include the value of no difference.
