## Importance of [[Hypothesis Testing Terms]]

Drawing inferences about population requires additional testing. The observations or inferences that you draw from a sample is limited to the sample alone. However if you wish to know if these relations between variables exist in larger population or in other words if you wish to know if the results of this particular sample can be generalized to larger population you need to perform [[Hypothesis Testing Terms]] and few other things.

Hypothesis tests play a critical role in separating the signal (real effects in the population) from the noise (random sampling error). This protective function helps prevent you from mistaking random error for a real effect.

## Different types of variables

1. Continuous: Infinite number of values between any two points. Assess differences between values (intervals), and sometimes ratios. Spread, center, skew.
2. Discrete: Counts. Nonnegative integers. Similar to continuous. However, cannot divide them into smaller components. Finite number of points between two values.
3. Categorical: Finite number of values that do not have an order. No distances between values. Counts and percentages of values.
4. Binary: Categorical data with only two values
5. Ordinal: Categorical data with natural order. No fixed distances between the values.

## Different Types of Graphs
“We also learned how various graphs can help us explore the properties of different data types.

| Scatterplots           | Assess the relationship between pairs of Continuous variables                                                                                                               |
| Time series plot       | Assess change in continous variables over time                                                                                                                              |
| Histograms             | Assess distribution of a continous variable. Optionally include a catergorical variable that defines groups to compare distributions                                        |
| Boxplots               | Assess distribution properties of a continous variable. Typically, include a categorical variable that defines groups to compare distributions. Large data sets are better  |
| Induvidual value plots | Assess distribution properties of a continous varibale. Optionally include a categorical variable that defines groups to compare distributions. Smaller datasets are better |
| Bar Charts             | Compare counts or proportions of descrete, categorical, binary or ordinal data                                                                                              |
| Pie Charts             | Shwo proportions of a whole for categorical, binary or ordinal data                                                                                                         |
